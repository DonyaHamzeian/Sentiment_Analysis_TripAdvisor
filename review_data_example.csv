My first trip on this airline. A319 from Bucharest to Munich on Feb. 6, 2019 (on behalf of Lufthansa). Very nice experience. Clean airplane, inside and out. Very professional pilots and crew. The aircraft interior was well maintained. The flight was on-time, without incident and the landing was flawlessly soft. Overall, a great experience.

National carriers are normally comfortable with respect to generous check-in luggages, onboard dining and comfortable seats. Aegan airlines does not disappoint. Take-off and Landing is also smooth and perfect. For those travelling from non-schengan country to another non-schengan country, process at Athens airport is very simple - get down from the plane and the frist gate on the left is...

I chose this airline because of it's good reputation, and it didn't let me down. Al flights were on time, the hostesses very kind, during checking in give priority to families with young children. They always treat passengers with caramels as soon as they take seat, and with a juice or coffe during the flight. It is one of the...

I only took 2 flights on my trip in Europe, and the first was a nightmarish experience so this review would be written partly in comparison to that. My first flight was with Wizz Air, from Athens to Budapest, and my second flight is this one, from Venice to Athens.
A couple of days before the flight, Aegean Air sent...

Being afraid of planes and flying i must admit it's actually the only airlines i feel safer. I choose to take the plane from Lca instead of pfo and fly with Aegean because it gives me the feeling of security. Overall smooth flights with good service. i liked a lot the entertainment on the plane with aegean stream! Just a...

Check in was efficient. I had purchased extra baggage online which was very convenient for me. Flight took off on time and was very smooth. Flight attendants were very friendly and cooperative. Aircraft was clean, and legroom was ok. Will travel again with Aegean airlines.

Despite the good service onboard and the comfort I can't recommend Aegean Airlines. Both the flight from Amman to Athens and the following one to Rome took off about one hour late. It's the only experience I had with them buy with this result I cannot be satisfied.

Being bused to the plane was a new experience for us, a long wait once we boarded service on board was good keep carry on luggage to a minimum the plane was full and not enough room for luggage. Short flight, good service when we arrived at airport very easy to find luggage, baggage handlers were rough with bags we...

Finally, comfortable seats on moderate prices. In addition, warm food was served for breakfast. The pilot also landed without bouncing the plane on the runway.

For a busy flight it was managed well without any major issues. The food on the way out was pretty awful though so I would recommend bringing your own. No inflight entertainment but it's not a long flight so would not have expected it.

Great airline, good service, excellent crews. Always a pleasure flying Aegean Airlines when I'm in Greece. Planes (jet) look new, prop planes tend to be a bit weathered. In any case, crews are always extremely professional and courteous. When island hopping noting beats them, including the long ferries.

I flew on Aegean from Athens to Cairo--a direct flight--and when I arrived in Cairo I received a text informing me that my bag did not arrive in Cairo with me. When I checked my bag that morning 2.5 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart, the rude airline employee put my bag on the conveyor belt after tagging...

It's a mixed bag for Aegean - while the check in was one of the easiest and friendliest I have ever experienced, finding out that your flight to Athens was delayed due to a late incoming flight tinged that joy with a little dismay. The incoming flight had been delayed due to offloading of unaccompanied baggage in Athens, which kinda...
